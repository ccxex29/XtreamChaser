MWAHAHAHAHA! SO, WHICH ONE OF YOU WANTS TO DIE?

A savage fighter who uses a kickboxing fighting style. He's reported to have died twice and was somehow revived each time. 
He once belonged to an international police force, 
but Dr. Abel and Dr. Bosconovitch made him a replicant 
with a perpetual generator that keeps him alive.
