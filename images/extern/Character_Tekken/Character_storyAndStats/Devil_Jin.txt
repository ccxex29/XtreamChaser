FEAR MY WRATH

After he defeated Azazel, Jin Kazama was apprehended by UN troops. 
As his unconscious body was being transported by helicopter, he became
 possessed by his devil form, ripped free from his straitjacket, tore 
 through the helicopter's fuselage with a powerful beam attack, and then escaped.

Intermittently fending off the UN's attempts to recapture him, Devil Jin wandered the 
desert until he stumbled across a town in the Middle East. His arrival at the town's 
bazaar sent the civilians fleeing for their lives, turning the once buzzing settlement 
into an abandoned husk.

That is until a certain someone showed his face...
