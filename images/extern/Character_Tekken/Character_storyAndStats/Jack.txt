It was no secret that G Corporation was locked in a power struggle with 
the Mishima Zaibatsu. However, within G Corp itself, another battle was 
raging: the battle to create the ultimate next-gen humanoid weapon.

On one side was the development team behind the Jack series led by Jane; 
on the other was the research team responsible for Gigas, a bio-enhanced 
super human. With his massive size and uncanny mobility, Gigas was hailed 
for his versatility in combat, and some saw him as more than capable of 
dislodging the Jack series from its position as G Corp's premier weapon.

Both teams entered their weapons into the King of Iron Fist Tournament to
 decide once and for all which was the best.
