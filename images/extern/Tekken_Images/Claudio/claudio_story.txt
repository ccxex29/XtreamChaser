HIS IS NO PLACE FOR AMATEURS.

The Sirius Marksmen, a secret society of exorcists, has exerted a profound influence on 
European history for hundreds of years. The most powerful exorcist of the current generation 
is Claudio, who was visiting the Mishima Zaibatsu as their groups join forces to subdue a certain evil.

After sharing information on the targets, Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama, Claudio left the control 
room only to be confronted by a young girl. He was about to call the guards when she demanded to be 
taken to Jin. A plan sprung to Claudio's mind.

He led her to the roof, and with a grin prepared to face her in combat.
