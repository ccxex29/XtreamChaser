HEY YOUâ€¦ YOU WANNA TRY ME?

Steve Fox has had plenty of run-ins with the Mishima Zaibatsu, 
but he never gave up his search for information about his past. 
Though his mother's identity remained a mystery, one name in 
particular began to crop up time and again: Nina Williams.

Believing she knew something, Steve began investigating her whereabouts 
until he came up with a promising lead. The information led him to an 
imposing cathedral. As he considered how best to proceed, a figure 
appeared from inside, dressed in a tattered wedding gown.

It was Nina, who seemed to be running away from something. Steve 
told her to stop, but she ignored him and fled. Determined not to 
let this opportunity escape him, he blocked her path.
