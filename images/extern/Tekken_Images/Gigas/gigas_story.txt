DATA DELETED

One of G Corporation's weapons divisions entered their latest biological weapon, 
Gigas, into the King of Iron Fist Tournament for two reasons: first, to pit the 
strength of their next-gen humanoid weapon against a similar weapon of G Corp's; 
and second, to provoke Heihachi Mishima.

Ironically, the first battle was staged on the rooftop of G Corp's own Millennium Tower, 
possibly in retaliation for their affront to Heihachi. Unmoved by the striking beauty 
of the skyscraper, Gigas awaited his victim.
