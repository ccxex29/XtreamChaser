DON'T THINK I'LL GO EASY ON YOU.

Eddy Gordo went to G Corporation to exact revenge 
on Kazuya Mishima for murdering his father. After he'd 
taken out a crowd of guards, a young girl in a strange 
outfit stood before him, and struck a pose. "You're not 
getting past me, old man! Teehee!"

What did she mean by 'old man'? Confused and irritated by her appearance 
and disrespectful tone, but aware of the threat she posed, Eddy prepared to fight.
