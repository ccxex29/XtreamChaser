COME AT ME! I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN

Hwoarang sees one man as his rival: Jin Kazama. Jin, CEO of the Mishima Zaibatsu, 
declared war against the world, and in the ensuing turmoil vanished suddenly, 
without a trace. Suspecting there is more to Jin's disappearance than meets 
the eye, Hwoarang vowed to track him down.

With only a shred of reliable information at hand, he headed to the Middle East. 
After a series of dead leads, Hwoarang heard word that a demon had appeared in a 
town. Without a second thought, he got on his motorcycle and hammered down there.

When he arrived, the place had been deserted, save for Jin Kazama in his devil form.
