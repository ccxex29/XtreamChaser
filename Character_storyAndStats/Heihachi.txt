YOU FOOL! I AM INVINCIBLE!

The original leader of the Mishima Zaibatsu, and the fighter 
known as the "King of the Iron Fist."

Heihachi continues to fight for control of the Mishima Zaibatsu 
against his son, Kazuya, and his grandson, Jin.

After having recovered from the injuries he sustained in the suicide attack 
on him from the G Corporation's Jack units, Heihachi is back with an iron 
fist--and body to match.
