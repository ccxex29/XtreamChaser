Once a fighter who had won the hearts of fans with his excellent 
sensibility and handsome good looks, he decided to transform himself 
completely by gaining weight to eliminate the perceived disadvantage 
he had in a fight due to his body type. His fans were disappointed, 
as on the outside it looked like he'd merely put on a few too many pounds, 
but Bob was definitely pleased with himself.
