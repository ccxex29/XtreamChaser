YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE READY TO LOSE.

After losing his sister in an airstrike ordered by the 
Mishima Zaibatsu under the direction of Jin Kazama, Miguel 
Caballero Rojo devoted his life to seeking revenge. However, 
when Jin suddenly vanishes without a trace, Miguel's life 
purpose disappears along with him.

From that point forward, Miguel began to wander like a specter 
from battle-torn town to battle-torn town. One day, as he ambled 
through rows of dilapidated buildings, he stumbled across a 
strangely familiar hooded man. There in front of him was none 
other than his sworn enemy, Jin.

Consumed by both euphoria and rage, Miguel becomes frenzied and goes in for the kill.
