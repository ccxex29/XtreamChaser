COME ON!

Feng Wei had always abided by what was written on 
the God Fist scroll: "Defeat all other masters and 
conquer their styles; the perfect warrior transcends 
all to become the Dragon God." Having fought masters 
of many different styles, Feng returned to his childhood 
training ground to continue his intense training regime.
 Then one day, an unexpected visitor appeared before Feng: 
 a mysterious man who exuded strength. When the man made it c
 lear that his desire was to fight, Feng had no reason to refuse.

He accepted his opponent's challenge in silence, and prepared to battle.
