## Project Hierarchy 
XtreamChaser is the root directory and the name of the project repository.  
XtreamChaser contains 3 sub-directories, some html files, and this README file.  
  

'images' subdirectory contains another 2 sub-directories that differentiates between images that are self made
and images that are obtained from external sources.  

'scripts' subdirectory contains another 2 subdirectories that differentiates between scripts that are made by the team
and scripts that are obtained from the internet as a library. Inside the 'custom', self-made script directory, there is 
another subdirectory named 'essentials' that is reserved for another scripts that can be shared among pages.  

'stylesheets' subdirectory contains another 2 subdirectories that differentiates between stylesheets that are made 
by the team and stylesheets that are obtained from the internet as a library. Inside the 'custom', self-made stylesheet 
directory, there is another subdirectory named 'essentials' that is reserved for another scripts that can be shared 
among pages. The 'essentials' subdirectory is *@use*d using Sass to the parent sass files that then compiled into css
