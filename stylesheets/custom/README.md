## About the Hierarchy

Let's call this directory as the custom stylesheet root directory. It's unlikely we need to call any 
custom stylesheet library, so I broke stylesheets child directories into libraries and custom.

In this root, we can see the files that will be interfaced directly to Sass interpreter. 
If we open the child directory named 'essentials', we will find things that may contain shared elements,
including variables, mixins, and classes. This directory is targeted by using '@use' on the Sass parent file.

## How to compile the SASS files into CSS

1. Install the latest version of Dart SASS (dart-sass) **This is the most updated official version of Sass**
2. Open the terminal on this directory
3. Execute `sass index.sass:index.css gallery.sass:gallery.css characters.sass:characters.css lore.sass:lore.css 
preregister.sass:preregister.css --watch` or `sass index.sass:index.css gallery.sass:gallery.css characters.sass:characters.css lore.sass:lore.css 
preregister.sass:preregister.css --watch --sourcemap` for browser live editing capability
